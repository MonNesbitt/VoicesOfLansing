<p> Hello!  This is a page about how language in Lansing, MI and other locales in North America are changing.  On this page, you'll find a brief description of the dialect spoken in Michigan along with a description of its history.  The next page will bring you up to speed with the findings of ongoing research my colleagues and I have been conducting with Lansing speakers.  Links to supplemental material can be found throughout this website.  Enjoy! </p>

<h2>The Northern Cities Shift Dialect</h2>

<p>The Northern Cities Shift, henceforth NCS, is a dialect of English spoken in what is known as the Inland North dialect area.  A collection of large cities in the Great Lakes are of North America.  Some of the larger cities in this region include Green Bay, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, Scranton, Pennsylvania and Syracuse, New York.  Linguists call the NCS a regional dialect because although the speakers of the dialect are of various social backgrounds (ethnicities, social classes, ages, etc.), they are all similar in that they were born and raised in the same general geographical space, often referred to as the Rust Belt.  
  
**************[insert map]*********************

Speakers in this region pronounce vowel sounds a bit differently from the rest of the United States.

<div>BAT sounds more like BEYAT</div>
<div>BOT sounds more like BAT</div>
<div>BET sounds more like BAT or BUT</div>
<div>BUT sounds more like BOUGHT</div>
<div>BIT sounds more like BET</div>

<p>Another characteristic of this region is that the vowels in BOT and BOUGHT are different.  In most other parts of the US, these vowels are the same sound.
</p>

<p>Below is a visual representtion of this pattern.  The figure is what linguists call a vowel space.  It is a graphical representation of the changes in pronunciation just described. The guide words are positioned to represent where in the mouth the tongue is placed when producing that vowel sound. So, for example, the tongue is placed higher and farther forward in the mouth when producing the vowel in BIT, whereas the tongue is placed lower and farther back in the mouth when producing the vowel in BOUGHT. The arrows indicate the direction of change affecting these sounds in the Inland North dialect area.

<h2>Recession of the NCS</h2> 

<p>As of 2006, 34 million people spoke this dialect and for at least the last few decades, sociolinguistic research has found that speakers in these places were continuing to pass it on through generations.
Surprisingly, recent studies in Chicago and Syracuse have found evidence of a new dialect in the area. Speakers in these communities are declining in the use of the features mentioned above.  My colleagues and I are also finding that the NCS dialect is declining in Lansing. Navigate to the "Lansing" page to take a closer look at what weâ€™ve found and then the "Contacts" page to find out about our plans for further research!
