<p> Hello!  This is a page about how language in Lansing, MI and other locales in North America are changing.  On this page, you'll find a brief description of the dialect spoken in Michigan along with a description of its history.  The next page will bring you up to speed with the findings of ongoing research my colleagues and I have been conducting with Lansing speakers.  Links to supplemental material can be found throughout this website.  Enjoy! </p>

<h2>The Northern Cities Shift Dialect</h2>

<p>The Northern Cities Shift, henceforth NCS, is a dialect of English spoken in what is known as the Inland North dialect area.  A collection of large cities in the Great Lakes are of North America.  Some of the larger cities in this region include Green Bay, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, Scranton, Pennsylvania and Syracuse, New York.  Linguists call the NCS a regional dialect because although the speakers of the dialect are of various social backgrounds, they are all similar in that they were born and raised in the same geographical space.

Speakers in this region pronounce vowel sounds a bit differently from the rest of the US.

<div>The vowel in BAT sounds more like BEYAT</div>
<div>The vowel in BOT sounds more like BAT</div>
<div>The vowel in BET sounds either more like BAT or BUT</div>
<div>The vowel in BUT sounds more like BOUGHT</div>
<div>The vowel in BIT sounds more like BET</div>

<p>Another characteristic of this region is that the vowels in BOT and BOUGHT are different vowel sounds.  In most other parts of the US, these vowel sounds are the same.
</p>

<p>For those of us who like visuals, below is what linguists call a vowel space.  It is a graphical representation of the changes in pronunciation I just described. The guide words are positioned to represent where in the mouth the tongue is placed. So, for example, the tongue is placed higher and farther forward in the mouth when producing the vowel in BIT, whereas the tongue is placed lower and farther back in the mouth when producing the vowel in BOUGHT. The arrows indicate the direction of change affecting the sounds.

<h2>Recession of the NCS</h2> 

<p>As of 2006, 34 million people spoke this dialect and for at least the last three decades, sociolinguistic research has found that speakers in these places were continuing to pass it on through generations.
Surprisingly, recent sociolinguistic studies in Chicago and Syracuse have found evidence of a new dialect in the area. Speakers in these communities are declining in the use of the features mentioned above.
There are indeed other dialects in other parts of North America.  [HERE] and [HERE] are a few references if you’d like to read more about them.  Recent sociolinguistic studies have found that the vowel pronunciations typical of these regions are also declining! Linguists have noted regional dialect decline in [Kansas City], [Alaska], [Colorado], [the Upper Peninsula of Michigan], [southern illinois] and [southern Ohio].
My research team and I have found further evidence of the NCS declining in Lansing. Visit the Dialect Change section to see what we’ve found.
